# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive health prediction system leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. The focus is on predicting three major health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's. By utilizing advanced predictive models, the system aims to assist in early diagnosis and proactive healthcare management.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web interface)
- HTML/CSS (for front-end design)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the application.
4. Input relevant health parameters.
5. Receive predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's.


## Future Enhancements

- Integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems.
- Real-time monitoring and feedback for users.
- Expansion to include more diseases in the prediction system.
